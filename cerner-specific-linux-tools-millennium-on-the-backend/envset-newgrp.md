# ENVSET/NEWGRP

### What is ENVSET/NEWGRP?

Envset is a command used on most appnodes to change your environment variables in Linux to the proper domain group. This command is an alias set up for the newgrp command in linux. It's not a real linux command. You should almost always use envset or newgrp when logging into an appnode.

```
envset <domain>
```

```
newgrp - <domain>
```
